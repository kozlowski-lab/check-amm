## What is it?
Check AMM processes Supporting Information (SI) documents to:
* Verify the integrity</strong> of Accurate Mass Measurement (AMM) data, formerly known as High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS)
* Identify discrepancies</strong> between the calculated and measured accurate masses and the proposed molecular formula, and
* Comment on potential deviations</strong> from the proposed molecular formula that would reconcile the calculated and measured accurate masses.
